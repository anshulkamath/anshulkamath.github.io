    "Improving code quality one step at a time: standardizing a fragmented codebase and optimizing performance",
  "projectDescription":
    "My job at Lulu was two-fold - first I was tasked with refactoring the whole backend codebase to increase readability of the code. This refactoring entailed migrating all of the serverless functions to a single, REST-compliant Express server. Next, I was tasked with finding structural bottlenecks in the code to decrease latency between the frontend and backend.",
  "thingsLearned":
    "Lulu taught me how to profile and analyze poorly designed code to find structural bottlenecks - these bottlenecks include capitalizing on opportunities for parallelization and reducing the computational and logical complexity of some blocks of code. These optimizations led to a 500% increase in performance (measured by P99 time per request) and a reduction from 20 API failures a day to 0."
