  "shortDescription":
    "A minimal dependency cryptography library written in C. The main goal of this project was to implement the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.",
  "projectDescription":
    "Two of my biggest passions are low level systems and number theory. This cryptography project is a perfect marriage of those two subjects. The overarching goal of this project was to implement ECDSA, a digital encryption algorithm, from scratch in C. I learned how to represent and operate on numbers of arbitrary length, how elliptic curve signatures work, and how to protect against malicious agents using side-channel attacks to break the algorithm.",
  "thingsLearned":
    "From the first objective, this project taught me how the computer represents numbers as bits, and how I could manipulate these bit representations to gain a new numerical system that extends the system's limits. Next, I learned about the importance of optimizing my code to increase the performance of the base operations, since these base operations are used many times in a single signature or verification. Finally, I learned how public / private key encryption works, and understood the ECDSA algorithm from a more theoretic perspective."
