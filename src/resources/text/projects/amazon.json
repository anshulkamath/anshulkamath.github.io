  "shortDescription":
    "Designed and developed a web dashboard for the Amazon Smart Air Quality Monitor.",
  "projectDescription":
    "The Air Quality Monitor is a new device created by the Amazon Branded Connected Devices team, and at the start of my internship it did not have a web dashboard. My job was to design and implement this dashboard to display the customer's air quality data. Additionally, I architected and developed a backend service to serve mock data to the frontend, since the frontend was unable to ping the Alexa service due to an unsatisfied CORS requirement. Finally, I added authorization to the website using Login With Amazon.",
