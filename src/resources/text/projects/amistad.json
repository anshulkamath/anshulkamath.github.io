  "shortDescription":
    "Conducted research in the AI/ML space. First author on two publications (one accepted, one pending).",
  "projectDescription":
    "I conducted research with the AMISTAD lab on Genetic Algorithms. Our work investigates the relationship between form (coherence) and function (lethality) in simple traps, and studies how genetic algorithms traverse their search space in the process of generating lethal and coherent traps. As the team lead in the group, I also coordinated meetings and delegated tasks within the group to meet paper deadlines. I was first author on two papers - the first of which was published at ICAART 2022, and the second of which is still under revision.",
  "thingsLearned":
    "During my time in the lab, I learned how to properly conduct research. This includes learning how to conduct experiments, how to collect mass amounts of data in a meaningful way, how to analyze said data, how to present the results and conclusions of the data to an audience that is not familiar with your work, and how to write/proofread a paper."
